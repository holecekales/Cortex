# Experiments in IoT

## Todo:

* In the debugging environment - download the entire file  
* What does the split over the 2 days (UTC) mean? Do I need to flip it to local?


**Fix https and wss**
* I think I need to get a cert?

* If the data is older than 2 hours, we should delete the data from sampleData - it means that the data is completely irrelevant.

**On the backend**
- Meassure when I last talked to the device
- Total since a day how much was pumped out?

Monitoring on the azure service.

**Firmware update needed**
* Get alarm going
* Get better reconnection mechanics
* Get reset going (if needed)
* Reduce the frequency of updates?

**HW section**
* Pump - install auxiliary pump?
* Can we have gravity drain?
* Water analysis
* Can I use it for watering?
* I need to research a bit tank
